        <p>Fry an egg, melt the cheese,
            and warm your tortilla all in the same pan.<br>
            Add your favorite toppings–like salsa,
            jalapeño pepper slices, cilantro,<br>
            and green onions–and enjoy a great tasting breakfast,
            done in a flash.<br> Of course, you can repeat,
            as many times as you like, if you have company.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoons taco seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 (6-7-inch) flour tortilla</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Let's do it!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 10-inch nonstick skillet,
            melt butter over medium heat,
            and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly. </li>
        <li>Carefully break egg into buttered
            skillet and cook until egg white
            is opaque and egg is firm enough to turn,
            about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Turn egg over, being careful
            not to break yolk; sprinkle with
            taco seasoning and about half of cheese. </li>
        <li>
            Gently place tortilla over egg and cheese,
            and cook about 1 minute. Using a silicone
            egg turner, flip the egg and tortilla, as one.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of the egg,
            and continue cooking until the egg is done
            to your liking and the tortilla is warm and toasty,
            about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slide tortilla and egg to a serving plate and serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
